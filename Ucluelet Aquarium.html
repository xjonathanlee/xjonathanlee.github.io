      <h4>INFO</h4>
      <p class="detail-intro">The Ucluelet Aquarium is a unique, catch-and-release facility on Vancouver Island that showcases local marine life from the nearby waters of Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds. Its hands-on exhibits and sustainable practices offer visitors an intimate, educational experience with the Pacific Northwest’s diverse ocean ecosystem.</p>

    <div class="p-hero">
      <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
      <p class="detail-intro">
    I was brought on as a volunteer designer for the Aquariums team to better streamline the graphic iteration process. In this role me and my lead Meredith looked at how we could better engage children with the treasures of the West Coast.

    <h2>Critical Question</h2>
    <p class="pstatement">* How might we make the aquarium experience more interactive for a child without the use of screens?</p>

        <h2 id="Audio">The Brief</h2>
    <!-- <p>With birding and spatial audio, I <mark>developed a visual language to catagorize and catalogue bird numbers and estimations of size</mark> that fit the visual pattern. By picking apart observations at a granular scale during an "exposure" we can give users a <mark>visual sense</mark> of where and when birds come into the picture to paint a landscape. Birds can be counted through observation, and tracked to their behavior patterns based on location spotted. While it is not an "accurate" portrayal, and you end up missing visual data, this visual system could be <mark>supportive of a robust information system as a catalogue</mark> (while also catering to birds not seen). The intent is to catalogue the data provided, but not take a picture.</p> -->

    <p>I approached the Ucluelet Aquarium in 2025 with an idea about visual encoding while recognizing a unique oppertuinity in the space surrounding data and tracking. My project was re-factored with a new problem set by my team lead Meredith, who at the time was looking to refresh and update all the signage at the aquarium as well as construct a new "play area" that highlighted the diversity of the plankton and fish in the Clayquot Sound.</p>

    <p>As the project progressed we began to see new oppertuinities to apply my design skills to an assortment of different signs / posts / and design objects throughout the aquarium. While also highlighting and classifying species of interest within the Nul Chalnuth Language.</p>

    <h2>Touch Learning</h2>

    <p>The original scope of the project was to work on how we could combine interactive learning with visuals, working with childrens natural inclination to move and play within the space. Ucluelet Aquarium used an open floor plan that got frequently wet, setting limitations on placement and materials for discovery. </p>

    <p>As we progressed in the space, we looked at different ways to "zone" the aquarium based on the type of learning that was involved. Early 3D explorations looked at the interation of space within spaces, surrounding and seperating areas with pops of color to highlight the "type" of tank and the exploration zone within the aquarium.</p>

      The different functional forms arose when realizing there isn't quite a one size fits all for sound illustration. The more complex the sound profile the harder it is to read. I figured a happy medium was a double encoding, one that highlighted simplicity and another that valued the full expression of sound.

      The map time and date was inspired by sundial clocks after a visit to a garden during the summer. Abstracting the dates and times of sunset and sunrise was a fun excersice in open wondering, and modifying for visual clarity after testing with friends.
