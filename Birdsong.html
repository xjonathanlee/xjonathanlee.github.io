    <p class="detail-intro">
      Recording nature has been done since the beginning of communication, from plentiful hunting locations to ample gathering spots, we've needed this information recorded some type of <i>place</i>. In this design study I've attempted to illustrate and abstract the "dawn chorus" and the "evening chorus" of birds in my local area.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>Using Nature Journaling as a catalyst to create, how might we abstract the "Dawn Chorus"?</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>I've been a nature photographer for about 3 years, and in order to catalogue new insights in the field I've taken up Nature Journaling during fleeting moments of quiet. Nature Journaling has opened my eyes to asking questions about the nature world and what our place is in it. As a side project I wanted to look at bird song and how we could look at Bird Song as a visual representation of place. This project started as a love letter to Giogia Lupi's "Dear Data" and over time morphed into something I cherish. I'd love to chat more about this process and travel the world to make scarves out of different choruses.</p>

    <h2>Designing a Visual Language</h2>
    <p>Taking inspiration from Nature Journaling Techniques from the Audabon Society I encountered a method for catagorizing and recording bird song visually. From this I extrapolated a visual language based on call frequency, call length, and loudness based on location. Drawing from my musical background it was easy to see how we could add musical symbols to the "score".</p> 

    <p>Below you can see John Muirs Laws illustrating this principal: </p>

    <h2>Auditory Sight and Seeing</h2>
    <p>With birding and spatial audio, I developed a visual language to catagorize and catalogue bird numbers and estimations of size that fit the visual pattern. By picking apart observations at a granular scale during an "exposure" we can give users a visual sense of where and when birds come into the picture to paint a landscape. Birds can be counted through observation, and tracked to their behavior patterns based on phenotype. While it is not an "accurate" portrayal of the exact species at that moment, it offers a glimpse into that slice of time on that particular day. Over a period this visual system could be supportive of a robust information system as a catalogue. The intent is to catalogue the data provided, but not take a picture.</p>

    <h2>Data Management and Sound Forms</h2>

    <p>Bird Song as a medium is difficult to abstract because of its variance in sound texture and call length. In order to present a consistent aesthetic I used this paper(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Natur.417..351B/abstract">https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Natur.417..351B/abstract</a>) as a metric to help reel in expectations of what an abstracted sound could look like. By diffrientiating bird song by length and by type (and by including a way to catagorize some birds as "unknown") this helped me create and define a color + texture pallette.</p>

    <h2>Visual Impact</h2>

<!-- Maybe an abstract image here or a gif that shows interaction? -->

    <p>Initially I looked at the abstraction of birdsong similar to reading sheet music. Tying this together visually with observations I noticed that many bird songs operate in the same frequency range. To get around this challenge I used a visual overlay to group different birds together, reducing complexity and increasing readability. By linking several of the same "songs" together on the weave, we could isolate and observe patterns in different birds and calls over time.</p>

    <p class="annotate">Explorations in design</p> -->

    <p> I return to the idea of musicality in later explorations,while also exploring the idea of sound and bi-directional mapping across mediums. By creating a way to illustrate time and direction as well as "intrusive songs" the goal was to create a sensory experience relative to timescale, allowing each observation to have its own "voice" musically.</p>

    <p class="annotate">Explorations in design(2)</p> -->

    <p>Drawing on Giogia Lupis ideas of "Data Humanism" I sought to allow the medium itself to be used as a "holder" affording a kinetic component to the sound map within. By positioning the scarf in the right area and place or by following the path I followed, I hoped to include a more sensory approach to just a conventional "data map".</p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p> A project that challenged my notion of "good" and "articulate" design by stressing how we catalogue map, and synthesize data in real time. Taking walks daily, opening my mind and sketching helped me negotiate the boundaries of my current design practice and help me better drill down to the core copetencies that I felt like I was missing. This project allowed me to explore data and translate that to a "felt" experience through a different medium. With luck, I can send these scarfs out as collection pieces on specific days, otherwise I am content with having one for special occasions that can tell a story. </p>
