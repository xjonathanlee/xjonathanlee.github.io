      I am designing a puppet for a cosplay competition. This is mostly a catalogue of thoughts instead of a portfolio essay. I just thought it would be interesting to put this out there.

    <h2>Critical Question</h2>
    <p class="pstatement">*Can I make a cosplay puppet like the one in "War Horse" using off the shelf materials??</p>

    
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>I've watched the development of Barnaby Dixon for over 5 years now, and have always been in awe at the lifelike articulated movements of the puppets posted. When I was approached by Chiyu about creating a companion puppet for her Mirana Priestess of the Moon cosplay, I was at first intimidated. But then I was curious, could I find a way to recreate the same movements found inside of his puppets into mine?</p>

    <h2>Data Management and Sound Forms</h2>

    <p>Bird Song as a medium is difficult to abstract because of its variance in sound texture and call length. In order to present a consistent aesthetic I used this <mark>paper(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Natur.417..351B/abstract">https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Natur.417..351B/abstract</a>)</mark> as a metric to help reel in expectations of what an abstracted sound could look like. By <mark>diffrientiating bird song by length and by type</mark> (and by including a way to catagorize some birds as "unknown") this helped me create and define a color + texture pallette.</p>

    <h2>Visual Impact</h2>

<!-- Maybe an abstract image here or a gif that shows interaction? -->

    <p>Initially I looked at the abstraction of birdsong similar to reading sheet music. Tying this together visually with observations I <mark>noticed that many bird songs operate in the same frequency range</mark>. To get around this challenge I used a visual overlay to group different bird songs together, reducing complexity and increasing readability. By linking several of the same "songs" together on the weave, we could <mark>isolate and observe patterns</mark> in different birds and calls over time.</p>

    <p class="annotate">Notebook Sketches</p> -->


    <p> By creating a way to illustrate time and direction as well as "intrusive songs" the goal was to <mark>create a sensory experience relative to timescale</mark>, allowing each observation to have its own "voice" musically. In subsequent exposures I wanted to create a way to identify sounds visually first by creating iconographs that correspond to the 3 taxa I've mapped sound into, this taxa was later simplified by shape instead of iconographs making the reading and translation process easier.</p>

    <h2> Functional vs Expressive </h2>
    <p>
      "Form following function" was the result of multiple iterations and studies of placement and scale. More specifically I wanted to look at how displaying the data aesthetically could lead to a better product.The <mark>hardest part here was finding a visual that showed cohesion and was bold enough to stand on its own</mark>. As I began to diverge from the initial idea of data formation, I explored other ideas that drew on pattern, repetition and more subtle encoding.
