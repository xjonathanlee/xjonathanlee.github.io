      Samurai Champloo expanded my knowledge in music and introduced me to Seba Jun at 13. When he passed in 2008 I was intimately familiar with his music that fused both jazz and hiphop. This project was a response to his albums he produced both solo and with his collective.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>Excersing our skills in data design how might we abstract the Seba Jun's discography?</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>I've been a nature photographer for about 3 years, and in order to catalogue new insights in the field I've taken up Nature Journaling during fleeting moments of quiet. Nature Journaling has opened my eyes to asking questions about the nature world and what our place is in it. As a side project I wanted to look at bird song and how we could look at Bird Song as a visual representation of place. This project started as a love letter to Giogia Lupi's "Dear Data" and over time morphed into something I cherish. I'd love to chat more about this process and travel the world to make scarves out of different choruses.</p>

    <h2>Designing a Visual Language</h2>
    <p>Taking inspiration from Nature Journaling Techniques from the Audabon Society I encountered a method for catagorizing and recording bird song visually. From this I extrapolated a visual language based on call frequency, call length, and loudness based on location. Drawing from my musical background it was easy to see how we could add musical symbols to the "score".</p> 

    <h2>Cousins + Other Things</h2>
    <p>With birding and spatial audio, I developed a visual language to catagorize and catalogue bird numbers and estimations of size that fit the visual pattern. By picking apart observations at a granular scale during an "exposure" we can give users a visual sense of where and when birds come into the picture to paint a landscape. Birds can be counted through observation, and tracked to their behavior patterns based on phenotype. While it is not an "accurate" portrayal of the exact species at that moment, it offers a glimpse into that slice of time on that particular day. Over a period this visual system could be supportive of a robust information system as a catalogue. The intent is to catalogue the data provided, but not take a picture.</p>

    <h2>Data Management and Sound Forms</h2>

    <p>Bird Song as a medium is difficult to abstract because of its variance in sound texture and call length. In order to present a consistent aesthetic I used this paper(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Natur.417..351B/abstract">https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Natur.417..351B/abstract</a>) as a metric to help reel in expectations of what an abstracted sound could look like. By diffrientiating bird song by length and by type (and by including a way to catagorize some birds as "unknown") this helped me create and define a color + texture pallette.</p>

    <h2>Visual Impact</h2>

<!-- Maybe an abstract image here or a gif that shows interaction? -->

    <p>Initially I looked at the abstraction of each song similar to reading sheet music. Tying this together visually with observations I noticed that many bird songs operate in the same frequency range. To get around this challenge I used a visual overlay to group different birds together, reducing complexity and increasing readability. By linking several of the same "songs" together on the weave, we could isolate and observe patterns in different birds and calls over time.</p>
