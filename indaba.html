    <p class="detail-intro">
      Design Indaba is an international design conference based in South Africa that supports design talks, exhibitions and celebrates design and creativity. In this project I look at reinterpreting the brand of the festival through synthesis of "design champions" like Tomato Collective, Ellen Lupton, Jet Set Experimental + Wim Crouwel.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>Using what we know, how do we design a fresh experience learning from our contemporaries?</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
<!-- Intital Mockups from Tomato + Synthesis -->
  <p>  From our time exploring design elements from Tomato Collective and Jet Set Experimental we looked at core synthesisies of their design process.</p>
  <p>During initial exploration I thought it would be fun to first design in "the style" of Tomato Collective, and tried to cram as many of their motifs as possible into 3 posters.</p>
  <!-- Demo1 -->
<!--     <img class="full-bleed lazy" src="img/lazy-load.jpg" data-src="#" alt="#">
    <p class="annotate">Visual Reference Guide</p> -->
  <p>From this I diverged picking the elements of their design I felt were the most interesting to explore. I knew I wanted to play with the ideas of scale and refraction from the start of this project. I used this as a jumping off point to look at interactions with other designers through either shared work or shared motifs.</p>
  <!-- Demo1 -->
<!--     <img class="full-bleed lazy" src="img/lazy-load.jpg" data-src="#" alt="#">
    <p class="annotate">Visual Reference Guide</p> -->
  <p>Approaching the 3 design motifs I made, I wanted each one to have a distinctive "DNA" empowered by the "End of Print" era of the 1990s
  </p>
  <!-- Demo1 -->
<!--<img class="full-bleed lazy" src="img/lazy-load.jpg" data-src="#" alt="#">
    <p class="annotate">Visual Reference Guide</p> -->
<!-- Demo1 -->
<!--<img class="full-bleed lazy" src="img/lazy-load.jpg" data-src="#" alt="#">
    <p class="annotate">Visual Reference Guide</p> -->
  <p>Aside from posters I wanted to look at newer ways to express this DNA through materials and placement. I wanted the motif of each design to be seen through both placement and human scale interventions.</p>
<!-- Design Directions -->

    <p></p>

    <h2>Visual Impact</h2>
<!-- Maybe an abstract image here or a gif that shows interaction? -->
    <p>Scaling for impact we knew that uncovering and "digging" through the digital space was an important touchpoint for a stronger UX experience. In the physical realm we looked at ideas of diffusion, layer and refraction as an analogue touch point, but digitally we needed our users to be enticed into exploring and uncovering elements within the pages.</p>
