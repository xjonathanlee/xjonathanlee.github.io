    <p class="detail-intro">
      Pacific Salmon Foundation is a scientific driven research and governing body that collectively looks at conservation, restoration and the historical documentation of the Salmonid population in British Columbia. I was brought on to revisualize key components in their new 'Pacific Salmon Explorer' that helps people make informed goverment level choices on infrastructure that could have impact on Pacific Salmon.

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>How can we create a touchpoint for gala attendees to stimulate conversations</p>

    <h2> Designing for the User </h2>
    <p>
      The Pacific Salmon Foundations Gala is the showcase event for the PSF cuminating in a dinner, an auction and an exhaustive list of attendees from organizations or companies that wish to support the PSF's current and future endeavors in natural resource conservation.
    </p>

    <p>While attending the gala with the PSF as a volunteer I was blown away by the sense of scale of the event. Intrigued by extending the users journey through the event, I wanted to see if I could find a way to extend the user journey beyond that just of the table. What if we could tangiably show data to users, with themselves becoming part of the art? </p>


    <p>To do this I looked at different ways of abstracting visual data taken from mentors like Giorgia Lupi and Federica Fragapane I looked at the generalized needs of the group. For this to be successful it needed to be...</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Be visually impressive</li>
      <li>Able to display "human-ness" across a large scale</li>
      <li>Scrappy and be able to be deployed in multiple settings</li>
      <li>Create a way for attendees to "cross pollinate" and interface with one another</li>
    </ol>
      <p></p>

    <h2> On the Shoulders of Giants... </h2>
    <p>
     I wanted to emphasize community with attendees as they entered and exited the event, using information and soft questions as a guide to allow for engagement. To do this I looked at how attendees operated inside events. During my research I noticed that people liked to do things with their hands and be active, this holds true for people of all ages. When faced with interaction users are more likely to create trust between customers and brand, as well as solidify an engaging touchpoint as a core memory of the event, especially in a non-traditional setting. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Within the scope of my initial presentation I did research on how exactly we "play with our hands" by going to museums and trying out interactive set pieces that could give us sensory information. Stacking bricks, voting by engaging with objects and watching animated infographics gave touch points that allowed users to memory make, investigate and critique in real time. Drawing on this exhibit design I used patterns developed by <em>Wim Crouwel</em> and <em>Giorgia Lupi</em> as inspiration, embracing the theory of "many in one" to unite multiple ideas together to create a unified "fingerprint" for individual users.

    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <p>
    To emphasize community I proposed a large scale interaction that leveraged size and community as a way to allow people to "cross pollinate" a freeform semi-structured board gave many benefits, cheifly among them being the opportuinity to avoid a massive bottleneck at the touchpoint, participants could always come back and construct their finger print during "off times" and at the end of the events a completed event board would show a "generalized sentiment" of the event attendees.
    </p>

    <img class="within-content-double lazy" src="img/lazy-load.jpg" data-src="img/raincoast/sd_1.jpg" alt="a moodboard of chinook salmon"/>
    
    <p>To accomodate for size and scale I proposed a board and peg system that could allow this installation to be scaled infinitely, as the fingerprints users make are "geolocated" (that is pinend where they are working from) there is a great deal of flexibility in how pegs and boards are positioned, allowing for different interpretations of the piece.</p>

    <img class="within-content-double lazy" src="img/lazy-load.jpg" data-src="img/raincoast/sd_1.jpg" alt="a moodboard of chinook salmon"/>
    <p>
    In a greater vein of ethos, I wanted this installation to be done "to the hand", giving each participant the ability to physically participate in their assemblage of the structure. 
    </p>

    <h2>Fingerprints</h2>
    <p>
    Fingerprints were inspired by how "many become one" in Wim Crouwels works, allowing shapes and colors to combine and fuse seperately,creating new symbols and shapes as cutouts and colors are additively stacked among one another. As multiple fingerprints populate the board we begin to see trends emerge from the questions, individuality slowly begins to merge with the identity of the event, and each persons identification plays a role.
