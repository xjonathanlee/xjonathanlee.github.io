    <p class="detail-intro">
      Pacific Salmon Foundation is a scientific driven research and governing body that collectively looks at conservation, restoration and the historical documentation of the Salmonid population in British Columbia. I was brought on to revisualize key components in their new 'Pacific Salmon Explorer' that helps people make informed goverment level choices on infrastructure that could have impact on Pacific Salmon.

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>How can we create a touchpoint for gala attendees to stimulate conversations</p>

    <h2> Designing for the User </h2>
    <p>
      The Pacific Salmon Foundations Gala is the showcase event for the PSF cuminating in a dinner, an auction and an exhaustive list of attendees from organizations or companies that wish to support the PSF's current and future endeavors in natural resource conservation.
    </p>
    <img class="within-content-double lazy" src="img/lazy-load.jpg" data-src="img/raincoast/sd_1.jpg" alt="a moodboard of chinook salmon"/>

    <p>While attending the gala with the PSF as a volunteer I was blown away by the sense of scale of the event. Intrigued by extending the users journey through the event, I wanted to see if I could find a way to extend the user journey beyond that just of the table. What if we could tangiably show data to users, with themselves becoming part of the art? </p>


    <p>To do this I looked at different ways of abstracting visual data taken from mentors like Giorgia Lupi and Francesa Franco I looked at the generalized needs of the group. For this to be successful it needed to be...</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Be visually impressive</li>
      <li>Able to display "human-ness" across a large scale</li>
      <li>Scrappy and be able to be deployed in multiple settings</li>
      <li>Create a way for attendees to "cross pollenate" and interface with one another</li>
    </ol>
      <p></p>

    <h2> On the Shoulders of Giants... </h2>
    <p>
     I wanted to emphasize community with attendees as they entered and exited the event, using information and soft questions as a guide to allow for engagement. To do this I looked at how attendees operated inside events. During my research I noticed that people liked to do things with their hands and be active, this holds true for people of all ages. When faced with interaction users are more likely to create trust between customers and brand, as well as solidify an engaging touchpoint as a core memory of the event, especially in a non-traditional setting. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Within the scope of my initial presentation I did research on how exactly we "play with our hands" by going to museums and trying out interactive set pieces that could give us sensory information. Stacking bricks, voting by engaging with objects and watching animated infographics gave touch points that allowed users to memory make, investigate and critique in real time. Drawing on this exhibit design I used patterns developed by <em>Wim Crouwel</em> and <em>Giorgia Lupi</em> as inspiration, embracing the theory of "many in one" to unite multiple ideas together to create a unified "fingerprint" for individual users.

    <h2> Assembly and Scale </h2>
    <p>
     Regional Overviews were designed as a way to extend the tool beyond that of just displaying data, capitalizing on a user need to have a quick easily digestable snapshot that helped relay the dire straits (pun intended) of salmon across all regions. In our initial mockups we wanted the user to situate themselves quickly providing a common narrative to help push past the complex data being presented. The initial designs featured a card system after front loading most of the auxillary information as charts that pertained to the regions conservation units and its over all biological status.
    </p>

    <p>
      Internal testing revealed that users were less likely to read the front loaded information, so after some deliberation we switched gears to simplying and focusing the data to be more visual. We replaced the introduction text with a card system that highlighted "glance-ability" so users could see immediately the impact across the region on all salmonid species. Across explorations we decided to speculate on more expressive ways of describing how users would interact with the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our final iteration we looked at a funnel system that helped center the user. Similar to the Eames "power of 10", we wanted to give a scope in and out interaction that allowed users to look at status then assess individually. We built this system directly into the overviews to give a stronger presence to this extension of the PSE experience that also lays a narrative thread to an experiential status site called State of Salmon (link here).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <p>
    Initially the incoming data showed biostatus as a mess of inflexible charts that created user friction. The information overhead was lengthy and full of jargon, as well as inconsistently formatted which impacted understanding. For the new re-design of biostatus across the tool <em><i>we used a traffic light system to qualitatively apply an already consistent design pattern</i></em> so users could recognize between good, moderate, and poor systems at play.
    </p>

    <p>Biostatus or biological status is tricky because while niche it is critical to understand the external pressures impacting salmon at a glance. Our initial understanding was to use a bar chart to quantify interactions along with a tri-badge to better facilitate dialogue between the different catagorization systems. After some research and testing, we began to see faults with the bar chart as users wanted to see more granular information from each individual pressure. </p>

    <p>
    In my redesign, data is sorted and displayed by confidence intervals in a 2D plot prioritizing mapping accuracy in the counted spawning salmon. In which, the variance in counting methods and the confidence intervals enabling users to do a deeper dive than just looking at a bar chart with numbers (instead you are looking at a 2D Chart with numbers AND lines). The flexibility given by providing options into the granular data helps lay-people using the tool to better reference changes in policy from external knowledge bases.
