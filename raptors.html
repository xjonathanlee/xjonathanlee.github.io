    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p class="problem-scope">How do we better evaluate health of animals through better interface choices?</p>


    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>Looking at historical architecture and peering at the patina of memory is never easy, but the process of peering into the layers of history presents a unique opportunity for architectural interventions. From multiple site visits we looked speculatively at how we could “process” and place buildings that exist in a historical context along a metaphorical grid that would highlight and displace the history along the existing grid of the fishing village of Steveston.</p>

<p>By integrating the methodologies of Eisenmann and his precedence of the fabric of the city, I tried to design a process in which we could look at the village as a blockade of walls, centering the user and evoking a quest in how to find more about historical centers by peeling back layers of history through sightlines and the perverse phantom grid.
</p>

    <h2>User Journey</h2>
    <p>Intercedence proposes an alternative narrative to the museum structure set out across Steveston by placing and moving users through a reward + denial system of grids and walls. In the speculations highlighted I propose 3 modular structures that touch on the ideas of memory and patina through architecture motifs from contemporaries like Peter Eisenmann and Kengo Kuma.</p>

    <h2>User Experience</h2>
    <p>Our team wanted to critique the “regreening” of spaces as a rallying call for gentrification, thus we wanted to look at a speculative product that would help the homeless while also oppressing them socially. We looked into spaces where
      homeless people gathered, and found we could also co-opt the space for a community oriented project as well. By recontextualizing the form the homeless shelters took, we could situate our form as a counterfactual object --- an object that
      defies what any reasonable person would do as both a way to obscure an existing problem, while promoting a “community - oriented” goal without having to re examine the implications of such a structure in a sustainable city.</p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>A project that built upon my existing passion for architecture and city scaled interactions, I noticed that our history shared or dismantled allows us to design for others not present.</p>
