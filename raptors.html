      We reached out to the Raptors for a process analysis project on communication, going through the whole design process we created a prototype that dealt with values and glance based communication within the facility.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>How do we better evaluate health of animals through better interface choices?</p>


    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>From our focus on communication we decided that we needed to do more fieldwork + research to better understand the frictions of the current system. In our analysis and workshops we developed a persona that would most likely fit within an employee at The Raptors
</p>
    <p>Through our further research we found frictions. We generally found that:
      <ul>
      <li>
      1) Detailed information is often “hidden in plain sight” making it hard to understand trends or history unless the issue was serious enough to warrant wading through books
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
      2) Difficulty documenting and searching things up unless directly spoken to, leading to many trainers having missing gaps on specific birds unless the issue was serious enough to warrant an all hands meeting3) A poor communication system that relied too much on uncrystallized information, in other words nobody knew the full picture.
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>A hybrid method of communication also offers distinct advantages than having everything purely digital. It offers greater accessibility across trainers, and it allows trainers to quickly cross reference data and come to conclusions during preflight checks, allowing users to quickly move from one task to the next.
</p>


    <h2>User Journey</h2>
    <p></p>
    <img class="full-bleed lazy" src="img/lazy-load.jpg" data-src="img/theraptors/FlightHealth Framework.jpg" alt="image of our critical speculation">

    <h2>User Experience</h2>
    <p>Trainers have options upon arriving at the facility for site prep, upon entering the facility and commencing site prep trainers can visually estimate the behavior of the bird before prep through the round up sheets at the front of their enclosures. Bird behavior and bird weight are visualized here as “colored blocks” for the past week, allowing trainers to guess on future behaviors based on present patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Intervention</h2>
    <p>Our proposal is to improve the communication of the trainers with a glance based communication system that would be mounted in the enclosure and paired with an app. Trainers would be better equipped to notice patterns in behavior or feeding that needed to be worked on before major flight at sites.
</p>

    <h2> Final Exploration </h2>
    <p>Our final exploration centered around a hybridized design to faciliate communication for trainers across facilities. We used a prototyping service to design a new interaction that could be maintained across multiple facilities through asynchronous data management</p>

    <p> You can view the prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/LS7sR5QwZhp9GPpJfieg3w/Prototype1?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=0%3A298&viewport=467%2C753%2C0.16&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=0%3A298">here</a>.</p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>A project that taught me the value of process analysis and design. By putting trainer interactions and bird health on equal footing, we could look at how our targeted intervention in process could allow for better communication in a resistant workplace.</p>
