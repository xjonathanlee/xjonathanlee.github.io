          <p class="detail-intro">I've always been fascinated with paper mechanisms, broadening my practice I bought a laser cutter after experimenting with one at school. As my process shifts I've done my best to document how we can transform paper into cards that balance aesthetics and wonder.</p>

          Originally just limited to Christmas Cards, this page intends to document my explorations with my laser cutter and the different ways we can explore paper through texture, structure and aesthetics.

      <p class="pstatement">*How do you have your designs <mark>scale for impact</mark>? </p> 
      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        An exploration of paper and taking a line of light for a walk!
    </p>
    <p>
I designed my first card "woodland walk" as a test to see whether I could use the laser cutter to its fullest extent.
      <i>(NB: Subject to change)</i>
      </p>
      <h2>Precedence</h2>
      <p>
      Over the course of this multiyear project I've started to encorperate references from the Bauhaus (thanks Josef Albers) to other card makers like Emi Hazlett, Richard Sweeney and PORIGAMI.

      Using a laser cutter allows me to experiement with form, light and shadow while incorperating flare in the form of design and execution.

    <h2> Selected Cards </h2>
    <p>
      These are some of the selected cards (and errata) I've designed over the past 3 years. There is a story for each one, and many many hours trying to ideate a new way to integrate a paper mechanism.
    </p>
        <H2>Forest Walk</H2>
        <div class="sub-content-group">
        <ul class="sub-content-item2">
          <li><em>Mechanism:</em>Fold</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    <p>
      Forest Walk was the card that this project was derived from. Initially I wanted it to be free standing but I realized later on that I needed something to hold the frame together. The fidelity on this card was achieved with masking each layer and slowing the laser speed to ensure clear line cuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an experiement I prescored the paper with the laser cutter...

          <li><em>Mechanism:</em> Fold</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    <p>
      Inspired by Emi Hazlett I designed these houses to be combined together as a line of houses. I designed the cards to be scored and folded by hand, as the scored joints got rid of the paper creases created by engraving.

    <H2>Quiet as A Mouse</H2>
        <div class="sub-content-group">
        <ul class="sub-content-item2">
          <li><em>Mechanism:</em> Shadow Box</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    <p>
      Learning how to design a free standing shadowbox was a bit of a challenge, but the quickness and nimbleness of mice made it all worth it. Paper kerfing was measured with calipers before designing the stands. I used the old bellows style cameras as inspiration for the card sub-units. In the end, I ended up gluing together the pieces for a more cohesive final look.
</p>
<p>
    NB:  I actually designed rounded card corners for this card design because of a complaint from last year about pricking their hands on the corners!

      Researching the affordances and architectural properties of paper lead me to the one of the earliest forms of a Bauhaus excersice imposed by Josef Albers in the 1920's. 
        </p>
      <blockquote>Using a piece of paper create a dynamic form that shows the affordances of paper.</blockquote> 
        <br>
      <p>Inspired by this notion and the 2018 snohetta star design I wanted to create an ornament that looks like a swirling orb in flight.
      By taking a circle and making concentric cuts I was able to make the paper curve in 3 dimensions. This created an illusion of an orb swirling in midair.

    <p> A card that celebrates my god-brothers new baby girl. Expanding on their wedding identity in reference to their combined last names. I created a Pelican (Peli-Kim) to usher in a new chapter in their life. Congratulations to the both of you!

    </div>
    <p> Doing research I chanced upon Star-Maps and Astrolabes from the near-east. After a couple weeks of ideation and sketching and some very rough paper prototypes I came up with the idea of a simple star chart that used a simplified grommet mechanism to turn. Viewable from the front the star chart was made in 3 variations (Hong Kong, Vancouver and Toronto) to cater to all my friends living in different places.
