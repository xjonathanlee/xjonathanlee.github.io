    <h2>problem</h2>
    <p>A hypothetical look on existing homeless infrastructure in Vancouver. Amplifying the current needs of affordable housing into a speculative homeless design project that critiques the current status quo. In short, how do we suit the needs of impoverished communities while still maintaining current gathering spaces. </p>

    <h2>design process</h2>
    <p>Our research led us to develop several forms that amplify the existing status quos affordable housing crisis. Whereby the government fails to take care of its most vulnerable citizens. By stipulating the conditions of an “aesthetic” shelter, we can reintegrate the problem of homelessness back into the very fabric of the city, by adopting the guise of a beneficial program that caters to green gentrification, modifying the resulting outcome so that the inoffensiveness of “hiding” a current problem could be more palatable to urban affluent communities.</p>

    <h3> peer feedback</h3>
    <p>Originally taking the form of an addition to a building, the usage of the pod concept was a design choice made early on as it played nicely into a niche role of green gentrification through a guise of social mobility. As we approached our new form, our colleagues advised us to further look at how these materials might be presented in context of the city. Looking critically at current plans and trends among politicians to make our product believable and fit nicely into our current world.</p>

    <h3> critical speculation</h3>
    <p>MakePretty seeks to critically examine how we design for marginalized communities by amplifying the existing problems of city infrastructure and planning. As a society we frequently ignore or further marginalize these minorities, by isolating them further through “green” initiatives that beautify but further isolating existing populations of homelessness. Our goal here was to amplify but also obscure the problem by asking viewers to critically question how our cities remain sustainable through rapid growth. </p>

    <h2> final exploration </h2>
    <p>Our team wanted to critique the “regreening” of spaces as a rallying call for gentrification, thus we wanted to look at a speculative product that would help the homeless while also oppressing them socially. We looked into spaces where
      homeless people gathered, and found we could also co-opt the space for a community oriented project as well. By recontextualizing the form the homeless shelters took, we could situate our form as a counterfactual object --- an object that
      defies what any reasonable person would do as both a way to obscure an existing problem, while promoting a “community - oriented” goal without having to re examine the implications of such a structure in a sustainable city.</p>

    <h2> reflection </h2>
    <p>A project that built upon my existing passion for architecture and city scaled interactions, our team noticed that the project --- much like real world interactions are never truly linear. Looking back, our initial struggle wasn’t so much
      dealing with forms, but how to present each artefact present.
      <br>There's a certain presence to a team when it clicks well, when on the same page we have the power to shape public perception about projects even if they are speculative, and therefore alter their behaviour in tandem with the product presented.
      This project showed me speculative design, or rather design in general is never meant to be “just pretty” but rather its a case to show our intentions to how we change public perceptions about the places we work, live and play.</p>
