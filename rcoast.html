      Launched in 1979 Raincoast conservation is a team of scientists and conservationists that strive to safeguard British Columbias most precious ecological resources. I was brought on as a data storyteller to help craft a story that could get more people interested in the challenges of Early spring salmon in the Fraser River.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>How do we tell a visually engaging story with data, while preserving the narrative of Salmon conservation?</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>Beginning with the data set, we were keen on exploring a visually expressive way to tell information to lay-persons passionate about British Columbias unique aquatic ecosystems. Given Salmon is an economic driver and a unique resource of BC 86% of lay people are concerned about the declining salmon stocks in BC, with a further 48% are concerned about hatcheries and farmed salmon (PSF,2022).  </p>
<!-- https://psf.ca/salmon/#:~:text=restore%20Pacific%20salmon.-,Hatcheries,concerned%20with%20hatcheries%20(48%25). -->
    <p>After discussion my team knew we needed an expressive way to tell the story of 40 years of decline without sounding cliche, looking at historical precedence and touch-stones that could ground an experience in nostalgia and fact.

    <h2> Designing for the User </h2>
    <p>
      I proposed a two fold solution that allowed the data to tell an emerging story, coupled with a narrative that could help illustrate the strong historical ties to the salmon trade the Albion Fisheries had.  
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li> A microsite that used "scrolly-telling".</li>
      <li> A data visual that could explain decline accurately.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
     During our research we uncovered salmon conservation stories and efforts from the government using structured data from the Albion Test Fisheries. Traditionally the data formatted was compiled by PDF by week, making extraction of the data messy and hard to parse across a large time frame. Fortunately, we were granted access to the DFO database server to create a tidy CSV.

    <h2>Narratives across cultures</h2>

    <p>The visualization and narrative content helps Raincoast stand out in a crowd of papers and figures by crafting a unique data driven graphic and narrative story telling experience that is aligned with scientific rigour expected from a conservation group.</p>
    
    <p>The result is a narrative piece and a data driven visualization that uses empathy and history to help connect research and narratives visually. Resulting in an lower barrier to entry and increasing access to knowledge.</p>

    <h2>Interaction</h2>

    <p>By allowing users to pace themselves, one can look at the content as a way to inform users without overwhelming them. Given a high level overhead combined with a reflection section that drives home intent across different levels of media (mixing article and scroll interactions), we can ensure users adopt and process the message we are telling them instead of mindlessly scrolling.</p>

    <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
    <p>Initially the salmon team wanted a data visualization that illustrated the decline of S4 Fraser River Chinook over the span of the Albion Test Fishery running.</p>

    <p>Archival research informed me of different ways I could express the data as an abstracted form, instead of using "just fish". Inspired by the salmon skin books from the 1920's (conviniently found in an associated attic) I began to deconstruct the idea of a visualization into less complex shapes, hoping to illustrate decline consicely by also introducing new bits of information as part of the design scaffold. </p>

    <p></p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>A project that challenged my abilities to synthesize data and craft a compelling narrative through cue based visuals. I learned how to better craft stories through orientating data in space, but also to provide a backdrop to greater issues facing salmon conservation.</p>
