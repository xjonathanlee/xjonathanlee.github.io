    <p class="detail-intro">
      Launched in 1979 Raincoast conservation is a team of scientists and conservationists that strive to safeguard British Columbias most precious ecological resources. I was brought on as a data storyteller to help craft a story that could get more people interested in the challenges of Early spring salmon in the Fraser River.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>How can we tell the 40 year decline and collaspe of Fraser River Chinook?</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>Beginning with the data set, we were keen on exploring a visually expressive way to tell information to lay-persons passionate about British Columbias unique aquatic ecosystems. Given Salmon is an economic driver and a unique resource of BC 86% of lay people are concerned about the declining salmon stocks in BC, with a further 48% are concerned about hatcheries and farmed salmon (PSF,2022).  </p>
<!-- https://psf.ca/salmon/#:~:text=restore%20Pacific%20salmon.-,Hatcheries,concerned%20with%20hatcheries%20(48%25). -->
    <p>After discussion my team knew we needed an expressive way to tell the story of 40 years of decline without sounding cliche, looking at historical precedence and touch-stones that could ground an experience in nostalgia and fact.

    <h2> Designing for the User </h2>
    <p>
      I proposed a two fold solution that allowed the data to tell an emerging story, coupled with a narrative that could help illustrate the strong historical ties to the salmon trade the Albion Fisheries had.  
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li> A microsite that used "scrolly-telling".</li>
      <li> A data visual that could explain decline accurately.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
     During our research we uncovered salmon conservation stories and efforts from the government using structured data from the Albion Test Fisheries. Traditionally the data formatted was compiled by PDF by week, making extraction of the data messy and hard to parse across a large time frame. Fortunately, we were granted access to the DFO database server to create a tidy CSV. 
    </p>

    <h2>Visual Impact</h2>

    <p>The visualization and narrative content helps Raincoast stand out in a crowd of papers and figures by crafting a unique data driven graphic and narrative story telling experience that is aligned with scientific rigour expected from a conservation group.</p>
    
    <p>The result is a narrative piece and a data driven visualization that uses empathy and history to help connect research and narratives visually. Resulting in an lower barrier to entry and increasing access to knowledge.</p>
<!-- Maybe an abstract image here or a gif that shows interaction? -->
    <h2>Interaction</h2>

    <p>By allowing users to pace themselves, one can look at the content as a way to inform users without overwhelming them. Given a high level overhead combined with a reflection section that drives home intent across different levels of media (mixing article and scroll interactions), we can ensure users adopt and process the message we are telling them instead of mindlessly scrolling.</p>

    <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
    
    <p>Initially the salmon team wanted a data visualization that illustrated the decline of S4 Fraser River Chinook over the span of the Albion Test Fishery running.</p>
    <!-- Salmon Skin books -->

    <p class="annotate">Chinook Salmon abstracted looks kinda neat.</p>
    <p>Archival research informed me of different ways I could express the data as an abstracted form, instead of using "just fish". Inspired by the salmon skin books from the 1920's (conviniently found in an associates attic)</p>

    <p> By abstracting a "walls of scales" we begin to see a story unfold across 42 years of the Albion test fishery. Patterns begin to emerge as we look at data holistically instead of just individually. From this </p>

    <h2>Putting it all Together</h2>
    <p> The initial implementation ran into many problems... cheifly among them being an extremely slow loading speed (at 36.6 seconds!). With this in mind (and 4 monthes after my internship ended) I wanted to expand on this project and give it the pizazz that it truly deserved. Peeking under the hood, I noticed that the video was among the things causing a loading problem, even at a reduced downsampled rate the loading times were atrocious.</p>

    <!-- <img class="within-content lazy" src="img/lazy-load.jpg" data-src="img/raincoast/abstraction_1.png" alt="different ways to display data"/> -->

    <p> I wanted to restructure the website to allow for a better flow, but more importantly I wanted to reduce the lag time between sections, and maybe in the background add a few more interactive components that could enhance the reader's experience. The current iteration although sleek on my computer, failed to meet my recently honed knowledge of good / clean UX and content strategy.</p>

    <p>Looking at how other articles were structured I realized mine relied on the video to do heavy lifting, to reduce this I came up with a different type of plan in order to mitigate these loading problems. Breaking up the video into chunks would allow more efficient loading, but also allocating some resources to interactive elements would also help guide users. In order to do this though I would need to access the original unpruned version of the script, or barring that create a new script that would be a suitable article length.</p>

    <h2>Scroll Points and Point points</h2>

    <p> Accessing the script was the easy part, after cross referencing the factoids and the pacing, I decided to gather more information that could play with the flexibility of an article. Using the script as a guide I found additional data... 

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>A project that challenged my abilities to synthesize data and craft a compelling narrative through cue based visuals. I learned how to better craft stories through orientating data in space, but also to provide a backdrop to greater issues facing salmon conservation.</p>
