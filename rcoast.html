      Describing facts and figures to the lay person can be hard. I made data visualization about the collapse of Chinook Salmon tell a visually appealing story and bridge a narrative through research creation and speculative design.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>How do we tell a visually engaging story with data, while preserving the narrative of Salmon conservation?</p>


    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>I began with </p>

    <p>By integrating the methodologies of Eisenmann and his precedence of the fabric of the city, I tried to design a process in which we could look at the village as a blockade of walls, centering the user and evoking an image in how to find more about historical centers by peeling back layers of history through sightlines and the so called "patina of history".
    </p>

    <h2>Critical Speculation</h2>
    <p>Intercedence proposes an alternative narrative to the museum structure set out across Steveston by placing and moving users through a reward + denial system of grids and walls. In the speculations highlighted I propose 3 modular structures that touch on the ideas of memory and patina through architecture motifs from contemporaries like Peter Eisenmann and Kengo Kuma.</p>
    
    <p>By providing a conduit for memories and history through the vernacular history of Steveston, this project sought to address the "whiteness" of architecture around Steveston and the obliteration of the past. By approaching the sensitive subjects of historical obliteration with kindness, Intercedence seeks a compromise with the Nikkei and the Fisheries as a way to erect temporary architecture that touches on history, inviting users to be comfortable with the uncomfortable past.</p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>A project that challenged my abilities to synthesize data and craft a compelling narrative through cue based visuals. I learned how to better craft stories through orientating data in space, but also to provide a backdrop to greater issues facing salmon conservation.</p>
