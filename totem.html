      <h4>INFO</h4>
      <p class="detail-intro">A project by WOHA architects, I wanted to see if I could expand the typology of a totem to the pacific northwest. As both an amature ecology and a budding designer I thought it would be a cool idea to practice both of these skills and build a relational product.</p>

      <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
      <p class="detail-intro">
        Totems for the 21st Century is a movement conceptualized by Richard Hassell, a director of WOHA Architects. Totems are conceptual pieces that can take any form. With this in mind I sought out to design an urban totem for the Pacific NorthWest. With the temperate climate in Richmond there are already ample “totemic” interfaces in parks and meadows that help local birds like tree swallows, purple martins and Barn Owls establish nesting sites.

    <h2>Critical Question</h2>
    <p class="pstatement">*Using a pre-exsisting typology, <mark>how might we adapt its use to suit a community</mark> that differs by climate and care?</p>

    <h2>Designing for non-humans</h2>
    <p>It's hard to think of building homes for animals as simply a creative endeavor, as the care of the animal is often in question. Many variables exsist outside of just creating "a house" for something other than us. I ended up taking this idea further and wanting to design for three animals ( 2 birds, and 1 mammal).
    </p>
    <p>I chose Northern Flickers (Colaptes <i>auratus</i>), House Wren (Troglodytes <i>aedon</i>), and the pugnacious Douglas Squirrel(Tamiasciurus <i>douglasii</i>) because of how they shaped my neighbourhood in Vancouver. Perhaps as an academic I wanted to really reflect on the biome I live in, but also because wryly as a child I was never allowed to have pets.

    <h2>Defining a Totem</h2>
    <p>Totems are designed objects that are intersecting between the "human" (anthroposcene) and the natural world. They act as intermediaries and symbols as commitments to preserve wilderness.</p>

    </a>
    <p>
      Totems are different than bird boxes because they improve the visual and aesthetic experience and give an excuse to use product design skills to produce something that is both functional to the animal and beautiful to us humans. Now instead of my neighbours fighting the woodpecker that has taken up residence in their shed, they can give him a place to live and he can continue eating the caterpillars that destroy our fig trees yearly.

    <h2>Affordances and Materials</h2>
    <p>Material constraints are a big deal especially when its a passion project. Since I wanted this to be a "total work" I thought it would be smart to use materials that were both bio-degradable, bird and mammal friendly and gave a nice patina. So in laymans terms this meant no copper, no metals except for a large pole and some screws, and things for animals to really sink their teeth (or their beaks) into. This is a flat lay of the materials I had envisioned for this project.</p>
