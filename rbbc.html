      <h2>problem</h2>
      <p>
      The project explores the topic of wealth and inequality in the context of how we interact with spending and money. Specifically, we want to examine the impact of money, changing the material speculation instead to reimage the possibility of paying with blood as an alternative to making credit payments.

      Critically, we wanted to examine how social and ritualized purchases change when interacting with blood instead of credit. These new habits involve how payment would be processed and how users would accumulate debt through their spending.

      <h2>design process</h2>
      <h3>context + domain</h3>
      <p>
      Contextually, the project is meant to exist within the world where blood marketing is commonplace within a first world country. We wanted to situate the user in a domain as if the target audience would be shopping for a new card or looking for additional benefits to upgrade their existing card. The typical person in mind would be someone with an average credit score looking for increased benefits.
      </p>
      <h3> explorations</h3>
      <p>
      Our team aims to have the audience assess how money “changes hands” in this world. Instead of having money as a tangible/intangible resource, we challenge the audience to examine the usage of biomaterials as currency, critiquing the monetary cycle, but also drawing attention towards how much people are willing to sacrifice to acquire more money.

      By encouraging speculation through biomaterials, we wanted users to reflect on the accessibility of money through our design. By contrasting the ability to hoard money with the idea of literal liquid wealth, our team wanted to emphasize the accumulation of debt through the loss of the audience's biomaterials.

      <h3>peer feedback</h3>
      <p>
      Our colleagues found this project to be visceral and gripping, highlighting a need to explore speculative designs in relation to money. When designing this project, we were encouraged to dig “deeper” in terms of how money and wealth could be abstracted through a material, then using that initial jumping off point to further amplify and emphasize the differences in equality through the comparisons of products.

      <h2> Solution </h2>
      <h3> create a card that bleeds </h3>
      <p>
      Our solution for this speculative design project was to envision a world that would use biomaterials as money, limiting the user to how much they could spend in a given day. The emphasis on the accumulation of biomaterials was to emphasize the “impermanence” of new money focusing on the abstraction of wealth through different materials. Our team chose blood as a medium because of its immediate “presence” and unconventionality as a trading material.
