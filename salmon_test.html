				<h1>Chinook: the king of salmon</h1>

				<p>Canada’s Fraser River is one of North America’s most important salmon watersheds. Even at a fraction of their former abundance, millions of salmon can still return to the Fraser River every year.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
				<div class="card-wrap">
			<div class="card">
				<p>One of the most remarkable salmon in the Fraser River are Chinook. In Canada, Chinook are often called ‘spring’ salmon because they can return to their spawning rivers early in the year.  American’s often call Chinook ‘king’ salmon because of their large size.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
				<div class="card-wrap">
			<div class="card">
				<p>Chinook are unlike most other salmon. Some spend a year in freshwater streams before migrating to the ocean. This extended river stay has led to these Chinook being called “stream types”. Stream-type Chinook spawn in the spring and summer. Their fall cousins are called “ocean types” indicating their preference to head to the ocean after they hatch, and spawning later in the summer and fall.</p>

				<h1>The Albion Test Fishery</h1>
				<p>The Albion test fishery began in 1981 after the closure of the Fraser River commercial gillnet fishery. The commercial fishery operated in the lower Fraser River for decades until it was closed in 1980 due to declining abundance of early “stream-type” Chinook salmon.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
				<div class="card-wrap">
			<div class="card">
				<p>These Chinook travel long distances in the spring and summer to reach the headwater tributaries that feed into the Fraser. To travel this journey when rivers have strong flows from melting winter snow, Chinook need large bodies and high fat reserves. As such, the stream-type Chinook are bigger, older and have three times more fat content than Chinook salmon that spawn in the fall. </p>

				<p>Spring Chinook return to the lower Fraser River between February and August. Returning this early in the year (versus the fall) is the result of a <a href="#" data-tooltip data-tooltip-label="Tooltippery" data-tooltip-message="Genetically distinct sub-spiecies that help Wild Salmon survive in their own unique ecosystems.

				<p>Historically, the early stream-type Chinook were once the most numerous Chinook returning to the Fraser River. Now, most of the Fraser River Chinook run is from the ocean type fish that return later.</p>

				<p>The operating time of the test fishery now starts at the end, rather than the beginning, of April. This loss of data due to budget reductions has <a href="#" data-tooltip data-tooltip-label="Tooltippery" data-tooltip-message="The survival of wild salmon depends ultimately on genetic diversity. In salmon,genetic diversity is a result of adaptations to the local stream conditions found in spawning grounds up and down the coast." class="tooltip"> important implications</a>. When monitoring stops, it is hard to know if salmon are even present. Are there no fish returning in early April as the trend suggests? When data is not collected, the unknown status of spawning rivers has led researchers to call these <a href="#" data-tooltip data-tooltip-label="Tooltippery" data-tooltip-message="By 2000, 56% of spawning streams were very depressed.

				<p>The loss of the early runs of Fraser Chinook has important implications. The significance of their early run gene means that if these fish disappear entirely, they can’t be replaced by salmon programmed to return later in the year.</p>

				<p>Fraser River salmon are a critical food source for salmon-eating Southern Resident killer whales, especially the ones that return in the spring. </p>

				<p>
				When the abundance of Fraser Chinook salmon declines, the health of the killer whales, measured by their body fat, also declines. When killer whales get too thin and malnourished, their likelihood of dying is much higher.  Lack of Chinook salmon is one of the reasons  these whales are endangered.
