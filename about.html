          photographer + designer based in Vancouver, Canada.</h1>
        <p class="about-paragraph">I am a photographer, designer and aspiring architect from Simon Fraser University’s SIAT program.
          I am a builder and thrill seeker who enjoys conceptualizing new idea’s and playing with all types of
          materials.<br><br> As a designer I firmly believe that good design is useful and functional, but is also inviting and malleable.
          I am passionate about conceptualizing and articulating ideas in new and exciting ways.
          I love studying spaces and the things that inhabit them, people in their environments
          and the curious quirks of how people evolve with their cities.</p>
