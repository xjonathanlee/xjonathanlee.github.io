      We often don't look at music and data as interlocked entities, I created this design to help visualize the collaborations of Nujabes and his contemporaries. In this visualization we show how each of the tracks in his most seminal albums are related genetically.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>How do we design an exhibition to suit the needs of stories that were erased during the forced relocation of the Japanese-Canadians during WWII?</p>


    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>Looking at historical architecture and peering at the patina of memory is never easy, but the process of peering into the layers of history presents a unique opportunity for architectural interventions. From multiple site visits we looked speculatively at how we could “process” and place buildings that exist in a historical context along a metaphorical grid that would highlight and displace the history along the existing grid of the fishing village of Steveston.</p>

    <p>By integrating the methodologies of Eisenmann and his precedence of the fabric of the city, I tried to design a process in which we could look at the village as a blockade of walls, centering the user and evoking an image in how to find more about historical centers by peeling back layers of history through sightlines and the so called "patina of history".
