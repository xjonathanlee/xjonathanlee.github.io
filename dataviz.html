 <h2>problem</h2>
    <p>
      This project is based on Spotify data sets and the keystone moments in the COVID 19 pandemic of 2020. Hoping to answer the analytical question of whether music listened to in 2020 was either more happy or sad depending on the pandemic conditions. My project aims to look into the inter-relationships between music and notable key events in the pandemic, not limited to valence (emotion), "speechiness" of the music and overall danceability of the top music during 2019-2020.<em> Based on the CDC reccomendations of the time I wanted to answer the questions of whether emotiveness went up or down during the first year of the pandemic, and if so, how did the similarities track in comparison to a "pre-covid" year.</em>

    <h2> final exploration </h2>
    <p>
  The scatterplots in my visualizations allowed us to have a granular look at popular songs while the histograms and bubble plots allowed us to look at the popularity of songs and the emotiveness of each song ( at least according to Spotify). I used details on demand, pan/zoom and brushability to provide additional dimensions to the data. Additionally I linked the filtered scatterplots and bubble plots and then faceted the 2020 data set in the brushable data interface.
<br>
During testing for feasibility, users mentioned that they didnt understand many of the attributes Spotify provides, as well as making it more clear that interactions were enabled. In my user testing both users that I interviewed wished for shift scroll interactions that allowed for greater detail.
