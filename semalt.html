    <h2>design process</h2> <p>SIAR was an intensive 15 credit course spanning
    the 2018 spring semester, focusing on designing virtual reality experiences
    “for good”. As students we were encouraged to explore ideas that dealt with
    what we were passionate about and pursuing though ideas in the pursuit of
    either raising awareness or creating empathy with the end user. </p> <br>
    <p> Our research led us to develop several projects that were presented in
    an immersive exhibition that played with the idea of immersion through
    multi-modal mixed reality installations. Our objective was to stimulate
    documented reflections and discussions throughout the process of discovering
    what was “for good” for us. </p>


    <h2> Planning an Interaction </h2> <p>From our initial course offerings we noticed that extended wait times hindered the overall experience, driving people away from our immersive exhibition. We then implemented a 2 path strategy that catered to time spent in each VR experience, finally culminating in the same experience.

  </div> <h2> reflection </h2> <p>Our final exploration tried to sum up 18 weeks of study and making over the course of 6 hours. From learning how to lead, to team management this immersive course truly taught us how to work together as a coordinated unit. The most important thing this course taught me was how to limit scope. Going into the course we each had our ideas of what the “perfect” VR experience would look like, and how we could each achieve that, The course taught us to temper our expectations, and manage each of our time lines.  Being in such a close knit group taught us each how to work with others, and lead by example, especially something that one could look as inconsequential, could be a big part of the final experience. </P>
