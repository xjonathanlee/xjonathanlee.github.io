    <h2>problem</h2> <p>How do we Design For Good?</p>

    <h2>design process</h2> <p>SIAR was an intensive 15 credit course spanning
    the 2018 spring semester, focusing on designing virtual reality experiences
    “for good”. As students we were encouraged to explore ideas that dealt with
    what we were passionate about and pursuing though ideas in the pursuit of
    either raising awareness or creating empathy with the end user.<br>
    <br>
    Our research led us to develop several projects that were presented in
    an immersive exhibition that played with the idea of immersion through
    multi-modal mixed reality installations. Our objective was to stimulate
    documented reflections and discussions throughout the process of discovering
    what was “for good” for us. </p>

    <h2> Planning an Interaction </h2> <p>From our initial course offerings we noticed that extended wait times hindered the overall experience, driving people away from our immersive exhibition. We then implemented a 2 path strategy that catered to time spent in each VR experience, finally culminating in the same experience.
</p>

    <h2> FIT4U Implementation </h2> <p>In a Semester of Alternate Realities; an intensive 13 week cross disciplinary course, we were challenged to use virtual reality to create experiences for “social good”. In our mid semester project FIT4U, I collaborated on user onboarding and experiences, curating an experience for users before and after the immersive showcase, ideation, user journey creation and user implementation.

In one of experiences FIT4U --- a virtual reality experience that masquerades as a fitness companion, users give increasing personal answers to questions, that are later exposed in a “data breach”, this “head fake” takes users and exposes them to the dangers of social media and web applications that harvest your information through targeted experiences and “play features”. However, the hardest part was connecting the experience and the on-boarding to feel like a cohesive unit, without making it feel like a game show or forced.

  <p>Our final exploration tried to sum up 15 weeks of study and making over the course of 6 hours. From learning how to lead, to team management this immersive course truly taught me how to work together within a coordinated unit. The most important thing this course taught me was how to limit scope. Going into the course we each had our ideas of what the “perfect” VR experience would look like, and how we could each achieve that, the course taught us to temper our expectations, and manage each of our time lines.  Being in such a close knit group taught us each how to work with others, and lead by example, especially something that one could look as inconsequential, could be a big part of the final experience.

  By curating before and after experiences, I helped create a user journey that aligned with the groups goals of the “head fake” --- creating a diversion to show how manipulative data harvesting really is. By plotting a user journey and onboarding users, I could architect how users moved into the constructed world, giving them a primer on how our system worked and how to play it. After the experience, I gave users a continuum of the experience by introducing new characters that continued the experience in the physical world, illustrated as someone that was there to steal your data.
<br><br>
    Prototyping and curating a user experience through our “post” experience gave us a greater depth of data outside of conventional exit surveys. By creating an experience that lasted “through the exit” I allowed the group to gather more data, and give users a deeper reflection into the ethics of data harvesting. The user onboarding and prototype evaluations gave me a greater respect of how to construct an experience. Further, FIT4U helped me question the role of the “exit” in installations and immersive events that I organize and plan.
