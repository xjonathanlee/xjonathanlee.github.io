    <p class="detail-intro">
      Pacific Salmon Foundation is a scientific driven research and governing body that collectively looks at conservation, restoration and the historical documentation of the Salmonid population in British Columbia. I was brought on to revisualize key components in their new 'Pacific Salmon Explorer' that helps people make informed goverment level choices on infrastructure that could have impact on Pacific Salmon.

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>How can we design a better user experience for goverments to make informed choice on projects that could impact future salmon stocks?</p>

    <h2> Designing for the User </h2>
    <p>
      I proposed multiple solutions that looked at new features to color reworks that better streamlined how users of tool interacted with the PSF. In the initial discovery phase I was brought on to initially look at color and patterns, but as the tool grew in size and scope I was asked to reinterpret data, form new user patterns and implement general design changes to sections that linked to other sites.
    </p>

    <p>Some of my design contributions can be found in the list below:</p>

    <ol>

      <li> Implementing a "traffic light system" to better digest impact of humans in specific conservation units</li>
      <li> A complete redesign of how data is interpreted in client side graphs</li>
      <li> A ground-up rework of the Regional Overviews section that links with an externally developed site (State of Pacific Salmon).</li>
    </ol>
      <p></p>

    <h2> Regional Overviews </h2>
    <p>
     
    </p>
    
    <h2> Iconography </h2>
    <p>
     
    </p>

    <h2>Biostatus Overhaul</h2>
    <p>
    Initially the data science gave biostatus as a mess of inflexible charts that created user friction. The information overhead was lengthy and full of jargon, as well as inconsistently formatted which impacted understanding. For the new re-design of biostatus across the tool <em><i>we used a traffic light system to qualitatively apply an already consistent design pattern</i></em> so users could recognize between good, moderate, and poor systems at play.
    </p>

    <p>Biostatus or biological status is tricky because while niche it is critical to understand the external pressures impacting salmon at a glance. Our initial understanding was to use a bar chart to quantify interactions along with a tri-badge to better facilitate dialogue between the different catagorization systems. After some research and testing, we began to see faults with the bar chart as users wanted to see more granular information from each individual pressure. </p>

    <p>
    In my redesign, data is sorted and displayed by confidence intervals in a 2D plot prioritizing mapping accuracy in the counted spawning salmon. In which, the variance in counting methods and the confidence intervals enabling users to do a deeper dive than just looking at a bar chart with numbers (instead you are looking at a 2D Chart with numbers AND lines). The flexibility given by providing options into the granular data helps lay-people using the tool to better reference changes in policy from external knowledge bases.
    </p>

    <h2>Interactions + Redesign features</h2>

    <p>By giving users the option of granularity in their interactions we could encourage exploration by leveraging curiosity + structure, scaffolding users into how the tool works. In essence by frontloading the user in how the tool functions we could allow users to better digest the data.</p>
    <p>I proposed 2 added accessability points to better assist with knowledge management as well as streamline ease of use.</p>
    <p> In no particular order I designed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> A new feature that enables users to save charts they deem important</li>
      <li> A reworked color and pattern system that better looked at interactions between colors and patterns</li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>A 3 month internship that turned into an extended offer! I learned a lot from this role, as well as while sometimes best practice is... well best, sometimes there isnt time to do a full holistic review and we need to ship <em>NOW</em>. As a designer my work was challenged by data, and democratized design so I had to learn how to balance aesthetics with functionality, and while sometimes a graphic doesn't nescessarily look good, it has to be human readable and people friendly. </p>
