      Pacific Salmon Foundation is a scientific driven research and governing body that collectively looks at conservation, restoration and the historical documentation of the Salmonid population in British Columbia. I was brought in to revisualize key components in their new 'Pacific Salmon Explorer' that helps people make informed goverment level choices on infrastructure that could have impact on Pacific Salmon.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>How can we design a better user experience for goverments to make informed choice on projects that could impact future salmon stocks?</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2> Designing for the User </h2>
    <p>
      I proposed multiple solutions that looked at new features to color reworks that better streamlined how users of tool interacted with the PSF. In the initial discovery phase I was brought on to initially look at color and patterns, but as the tool grew in size and scope I was asked to reinterpret data, form new user patterns and implement general design changes to sections that linked to other sites. 
    </p>

    <p>Some of my contributions can be found in the list below:</p>

    <ol>
      <li> A new feature that enables users to save charts they deem important</li>
      <li> A reworked color and pattern system that better looks interactions between colors and patterns instead of stand-alone</li>
      <li> An introduction of new user patterns that scaffold interactions</li>
      <li> A complete redesign of how data is interpreted in client side graphs</li>
      <li> A overhauled tooltip system</li>
      <li> A ground-up rework of the Regional Overviews section that links with an external site.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
     
    </p>

    <h2>Interactions + Redesign features</h2>

    <p>By allowing users to pace themselves, one can look at the content as a way to inform users without overwhelming them. Given a high level overhead combined with a reflection section that drives home intent across different levels of media (mixing article and scroll interactions), we can ensure users adopt and process the message we are telling them instead of mindlessly scrolling.</p>

    <p>A 3 month internship that turned into an extended offer! I learned a lot from this role, as well as while sometimes best practice is... well best, sometimes there isnt time to do a full holistic review and we need to ship NOW. As my work expanded from colors to charts I was </p>
