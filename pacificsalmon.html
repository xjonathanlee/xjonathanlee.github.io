    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p id="UX">Through written user tests and a comprehensive process analysis, we implemented targeted improvements to the platform's visual design and user widgets. These changes helped scientists access their data more quickly and clearly. Internal testing showed a 9.46-second reduction in overall task time, enhancing user clarity and contributing to platform growth.</p>

    <h2> Designing for the User</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Researchers weren't spending enough time on research</em>, leaving problems like biological status and population numbers either crucially under-researched or under-represented in report finding. Oftentimes, end users needed to access multiple reports and access points to track metrics across various pacific salmonid populations, finding themselves stranded in a sea of data.</p>


<h2> Critical Question</h2>
    <p class="pstatement">*How can we design a better user experience for goverments to make informed choices on projects that could impact future salmon stocks?</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
My proposed user experience intervention involved redesigning the information layout through a parallel feature: the horizontal omni menu. This menu allowed users to search all phenotype-related queries simultaneously. By providing access to comprehensive information after filtering, users were better centered in their workflow. Additionally, the ability to save data to a separate tab created a quick and efficient way to catalog and organize informationâ€”eliminating the need to repeatedly navigate the retrieval process.

To <mark>standardize the icon set we set the icon sizing to a firm 36x36 square with a white border to optimize counting icons that were clustered together</mark>. In the icon redesign me and my senior team looked to group icons by color and key as well as redesigning the icons to read better at a low resolution.

     Regional Overviews were designed as a way to extend the tool capitalizing on a user's need to have quick <mark>easily digestible snapshots</mark> that helped <mark>relay quick statistics of salmon across all regions without having to do a deep dive</mark>. The intention was to situate the user quickly, providing a common narrative to help push past the complex data being presented. The initial designs featured a card system after front loading most of the auxiliary information as charts that pertained to the regions conservation units and its overall biological status.

      Internal testing revealed that <mark>users were less likely to read the front loaded information</mark>, so after some deliberation we simplified and focused data to be more visual.

     In our final iteration we looked at a funnel system that helped center the user. We wanted to give a scope in and out interaction that allowed users to look at status then <mark>assess salmon needs through a triage system</mark>. We built this system directly into the overviews to give a stronger presence to this extension of the PSE experience that also lays a narrative thread to an experiential status site called <a href="https://stateofsalmon.psf.ca/" >State of Salmon</a> .

    <!-- <h2>Smoothing Data for better Understanding</h2>
    <p>
    Initially the incoming data showed biostatus as a mess of inflexible charts that created user friction. The information overhead was lengthy and full of jargon, as well as inconsistently formatted which impacted understanding. For the new re-design of biostatus across the tool we used a <mark>traffic light system to qualitatively apply an already consistent</mark> design pattern so users could recognize between good, moderate, and poor systems at play.

    <h2>Reframed Question</h2>
    <p class="pstatement">*How can we influence readers to think about data in <mark>two-dimensions</mark>?</p>

    <p id="infoD">Biostatus provides salmon biologists with a quick overview of ecosystem health without needing to review all detailed data. It helps researchers plan their work efficiently without getting overwhelmed by extensive reports.
</p>
<p>
Initially, we used a bar chart combined with a trimetric badge (tribadge) to improve communication between different classification systems. However, user testing showed that the bar chart didnâ€™t provide enough detailed information on individual pressures, leading us to explore more detailed ways to present the data.

    In this redesign, data is organized and displayed using confidence intervals on a 2D plot, prioritizing the accuracy of counted spawning salmon. The confidence intervals allow users to explore the data more deeply by positioning information spatially within the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
By consolidating the data into a more visual format, we addressed issues of granularity and focus, enabling researchers to track changes over time more effectively.
    </p>


    <h2>Glance Based Information and Prepared Documents</h2>
    <p>
    A major point of user friction came from observing other users and their patterns navigating the site. The online portion was fine, but we observed a need for the information to be presented differently as a <mark>rapid printout</mark>. My team lead came to me to take a speculative look on how users would look at printouts of cogent information within the habitat panel and the biostatus panel.

  <section class="main-content">
    <p id="rollup">We <mark>created a way for users to obtain crucial information highlighting the "at a glance" principle found in both Biostatus and Regional Overviews</mark>. During testing we observed variance in how people used documents to track their thoughts and research. This culminates in a printout that could be assessed rapidly, allowing users to get a definitive top level readout without having to parse through the site.âˆŽ</p>

<!--     <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>A 3 month internship that turned into an extended offer! I learned a lot from this role, as well as while sometimes best practice is... well best, sometimes there isnt time to do a full holistic review and we need to ship <em>NOW</em>. As a designer my work was challenged by data, and democratized design so I had to learn how to balance aesthetics with functionality, and while sometimes a graphic doesn't nescessarily look good, it has to be human readable and people friendly. </p> -->
