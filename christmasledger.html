    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Increasingly Christmas cards are becoming the "way of the past", but so many of the designers of the golden age used christmas cards to communicate and give thanks to their clients in a myriad of delightful ways. Using precedence like Thomas Heatherwick, and Milton Glaser, I wanted to challenge myself creatively in how I could bring interactions and whimsy throughout the holidays</p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>Our research led us to develop several forms that amplify the existing status quos affordable housing crisis. Whereby the government fails to take care of its most vulnerable citizens. By stipulating the conditions of an “aesthetic” shelter,
      we can reintegrate the problem of homelessness back into the very fabric of the city, by adopting the guise of a beneficial program that caters to green gentrification, modifying the resulting outcome so that the inoffensiveness of “hiding” a
      current problem could be more palatable to urban affluent communities.</p>

    <h2> Critical Speculation</h2>
    <p>MakePretty seeks to critically examine how we design for marginalized communities by amplifying the existing problems of city infrastructure and planning. As a society we frequently ignore or further marginalize these minorities, by isolating them further through “green” initiatives that beautify but further isolating existing populations of homelessness. Our goal here was to amplify but also obscure the problem by asking viewers to critically question how our cities remain sustainable through rapid growth. </p>

    <h2> Final Exploration </h2>
    <p>Our team wanted to critique the “regreening” of spaces as a rallying call for gentrification, thus we wanted to look at a speculative product that would help the homeless while also oppressing them socially. We looked into spaces where
      homeless people gathered, and found we could also co-opt the space for a community oriented project as well. By recontextualizing the form the homeless shelters took, we could situate our form as a counterfactual object --- an object that
      defies what any reasonable person would do as both a way to obscure an existing problem, while promoting a “community - oriented” goal without having to re examine the implications of such a structure in a sustainable city.</p>
