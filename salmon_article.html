  <p>The Fraser River ecosystem in Canada stands as one of North America's vital salmon habitats that provide areas of refuge for Salmon. These watersheds; defined by the collection and flow of rainfall and snowmelt, direct freshwater into streams, rivers, lakes, and eventually the ocean.
  </p>
  <p>Keystone species, supported by the varied freshwater ecosystems present along the Fraser and its estuaries, play a pivotal role in shaping ecosystems from the bottom up. Chinook Salmon as keystone species are held sacred by the First Nations Communities that live amongst the Fraser River and its Tributaries. These Salmon, especially the Chinook are integral in shaping the landscape of the Fraser River region, providing sustenance to wildlife, people, and the land itself(). In fact, many cultures herald the early stream type chinook as the most important animal these First Nation Communities hunt for, the Spring Run being especially important for salmon rituals among the (??????).

    <p>The Chinook Salmon, often referred to as 'spring' salmon in Canada and 'king' salmon in the United States due to their early return and large size, are facing a decline in returning stocks. Chinook salmon exhibit significant diversity within their species, with distinctions between 'stream types' and 'ocean types.'

    <p>Stream-type Chinook, spend a full year in the river ecosystems before migrating to the ocean, spawning in the spring and early summer. These river-staying fish are special to the Chinook populations among the Fraser, in addition to being larger and stronger than ocean-type chinook, they have higher fat reserves when returning, making them a critical species for animals looking to up their calorie intake for the brutal winter months ahead, they are often the lifeline for bears approaching hibernation season as their huge fat reserves are a much needed caloric boost. 
  </p>

  <p>Their ocean-type counterparts prefer heading to the ocean sooner within their first year, spawning later in the summer and fall. These fish are much smaller than Chinook Salmon that arrive earlier in the year, and are typically less nutrient dense. elab>

    <p>The Albion test fishery, established in 1981 after the closure of the Fraser River commercial gillnet fishery, paints a concerning picture of the decline in early stream-type Chinook. The closure of the commercial fishery in 1980 was prompted by the diminishing abundance of these early-returning Chinook. Over the years, the data from the test fishery reveals a stark narrativeâ€”stream-type Chinook arrivals are progressively delayed,  while the total Chinook population returning to the Fraser River has had a skewed ratio of spring to summer.</p>

    A critical issue in the analysis is the shift in the test fishery's operating time, starting at the end of April, leading to a loss of crucial data due to budget reductions. This data loss has profound implications for understanding the presence of salmon and monitoring their status. The survival of wild salmon, dependent on genetic diversity, is particularly jeopardized by this lack of data collection.</p>

By the year 2000, 56% of spawning streams were deemed severely depressed(), with Chinook salmon, the largest of the five species, remaining severely depressed in the Central and North Coast(). The loss of the early Stream-Type Chinook bears substantial consequences, especially considering their unique genetic programming for spring returns. If these fish disappear, they cannot be replaced by salmon programmed to return in the fall.
