      Historical Architecture and the concept of the palimpsest are concepts that define places like Medina and Japan. In this paper I talk about using that same framework to interrogate the architecture in Steveston BC.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>How do we design an exhibition to suit the needs of stories that were erased during the forced relocation of the Japanese-Canadians during WWII?</p>


    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>Looking at historical architecture and peering at the patina of memory is never easy, but the process of peering into the layers of history presents a unique opportunity for architectural interventions. From multiple site visits we looked speculatively at how we could “process” and place buildings that exist in a historical context along a metaphorical grid that would highlight and displace the history along the existing grid of the fishing village of Steveston.</p>

<p>By integrating the methodologies of Eisenmann and his precedence of the fabric of the city, I tried to design a process in which we could look at the village as a blockade of walls, centering the user and evoking an image in how to find more about historical centers by peeling back layers of history through sightlines and the so called "patina of history".
</p>

    <h2>Critical Speculation</h2>
    <p>Intercedence proposes an alternative narrative to the museum structure set out across Steveston by placing and moving users through a reward + denial system of grids and walls. In the speculations highlighted I propose 3 modular structures that touch on the ideas of memory and patina through architecture motifs from contemporaries like Peter Eisenmann and Kengo Kuma.</p>
    
    <p>By providing a conduit for memories and history through the vernacular history of Steveston, this project sought to address the "whiteness" of architecture around Steveston and the obliteration of the past. By approaching the sensitive subjects of historical obliteration with kindness, Intercedence seeks a compromise with the Nikkei and the Fisheries as a way to erect temporary architecture that touches on history, inviting users to be comfortable with the uncomfortable past.</p>

    <p> You can read the final paper and view the final forms <a href="https://xjonathanlee.github.io/intercendence_essay_2022.pdf"> here </a>. </p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>A project that built upon my existing passion for architecture and city scaled interactions, I was interested in how we could preserve the memories of thoes that came before us in an interactive or speculative way that touched on travelling as a metaphor. In this project I found that my traditional "design thinking" methods needed to be shifted so I dove into research that looked at speculative and temporary architecture as a way to help connect Steveston with its past.</p>
