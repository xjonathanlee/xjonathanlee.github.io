    <h2>problem</h2>

    <p class="problem-scope">How do we design an exhibition to suit the needs of stories that were erased during the forced relocation of the Japanese-Canadians during WWII?</p>


    <h2>design process</h2>
    <p>Looking at historical architecture and peering at the patina of memory is never easy, but the process of peering into the layers of history presents a unique opportunity for architectural interventions. From multiple site visits we looked speculatively at how we could “process” and place buildings that exist in a historical context along a metaphorical grid that would highlight and displace the history along the existing grid of the fishing village of Steveston.</p>
<br>
<p>By integrating the methodologies of Eisenmann and his precedence of the fabric of the city, I tried to design a process in which we could look at the village as a blockade of walls, centering the user and evoking a quest in how to find more about historical centers by peeling back layers of history through sightlines and the perverse phantom grid.

    <h2> critical speculation</h2>
    <p>Intercedence proposes an alternative narrative to the museum structure set out across Steveston by placing and moving users through a reward + denial system of grids and walls. In the speculations highlighted I propose 3 modular structures that touch on the ideas of memory and patina through architecture motifs from contemporaries like Peter Eisenmann and Kengo Kuma.</p>

    <h2> final exploration </h2>
    <p>Our team wanted to critique the “regreening” of spaces as a rallying call for gentrification, thus we wanted to look at a speculative product that would help the homeless while also oppressing them socially. We looked into spaces where
      homeless people gathered, and found we could also co-opt the space for a community oriented project as well. By recontextualizing the form the homeless shelters took, we could situate our form as a counterfactual object --- an object that
      defies what any reasonable person would do as both a way to obscure an existing problem, while promoting a “community - oriented” goal without having to re examine the implications of such a structure in a sustainable city.</p>

    <h2> reflection </h2>
    <p>A project that built upon my existing passion for architecture and city scaled interactions, our team noticed that the project --- much like real world interactions are never truly linear. Looking back, our initial struggle wasn’t so much
      dealing with forms, but how to present each artefact present.
      This project showed me speculative design, or rather design in general is never meant to be “just pretty” but rather its a case to show our intentions to how we change public perceptions about the places we work, live and play.</p>
